### What is LCM?

LCM stands for least common multiple. The least common multiple of two numbers
is the smallest number that is a multiple of both of them.

##### Finding least common multiple

One way to find the LCM of two (or more!) numbers is to list the multiples
of each number until we find the smallest multiple they have in common.

Example: LCM of 8 and 10

Multiples of 8: 8, 16, 24, 32, _40_, 48, 56, 64, 72, _80_...

Multiples of 10: 10, 20, 30, _40_, 50, 60, 70, _80_, 90, 100...

_40_ and _80_ are common multiples of 8 and 10. 40 is the smallest one.

```
lcm(8, 10) = 40
```

### What is GCF?

GCF stands for greatest common factor. The greatest common factor of two numbers
is the greatest number that is a factor of both of them.

##### Finding greatest common factor

One way to find the GCF of two (or more!) numbers is to list the factors of each
number and find the greatest factor they have in common.

Example: GCF 12 of 18

Factors of 12: _1_, _2_, _3_, _4_, 5, _6_, 12

Factors of 18: _1_, _2_, _3_, _6_, 9, 18

_1_, _2_, _3_ and _6_ are common factors of 12 and 18.

_6_ is the greatest factor that 12 and 18 have in common.

```
gcf(12, 18) = 6
```
