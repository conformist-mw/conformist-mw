### What is LCM?

LCM stands for least common multiple. The least common multiple of two numbers
is the smallest number that is a multiple of both of them.

##### Finding least common multiple

One way to find the LCM of two (or more!) numbers is to list the multiples
of each number until we find the smallest multiple they have in common.

Example 1: LCM of 8 and 10

Multiples of 8: 8, 16, 24, 32, _40_, 48, 56, 64, 72, _80_...

Multiples of 10: 10, 20, 30, _40_, 50, 60, 70, _80_, 90, 100...

_40_ and _80_ are common multiples of 8 and 10. 40 is the smallest one.

```
lcm(8, 10) = 40
```
